                <img src="top10.png" alt="" class="png_1">
                <p class="sub_title">2.	What are the most popular types of Korean food here?</p>
                <img src="categories.png" alt="" class="png_2">
                <p class="a2_1">Here are the top3 labels of the restaurants. If you are a fan of fried chicken or Korean barbecue, there is a great chance that you will find an ideal Korean restaurant. </p>
                <p class="sub_title">3.	Is the price acceptable?</p>
                <img src="price.png" alt="" class="png_2">
                <p class="a2_1">The price per person of Korean restaurants in Hong Kong are mostly from 51-200, I suppose it is a normal price students can afford. Having fun in Korean restaurants perhaps won’t make you go bankrupt. </p>
                <p class="sub_title">4.	Which district should I go if I want to taste Korean cuisine?</p>
                <img src="district.jpg" alt="" class="png_3">
                <p class="a2_1">On the left, you can see the district with the restaurants which have the most average good comments. On the right, you can see the number of Korean restaurants in each district. I suggest the best district to taste Korean food to be 尖沙咀/旺角/銅鑼灣/觀塘 as they appeared in both lists.</p>
                <p class="sub_title">5.	The top5 Korean restaurants with the largest number of good comments in the 4 districts</p>
