                <p class="one">Hi, I am Jennifer and welcome to my website! <br>If you browse it in the full screen view, you may get better visual effect.</p>
                <p class="two">I want to make this website a place to show not only my assignments for this course, but also other kinds of my works. I browsed some online portfolio of designers, then I draw a draft of my own website.<br>After this was done, I tried to connect every part of the webpage to my knowledge about html and css. It’s relatively easy to follow someone to code step by step, but it’s difficult to code for your own design.<br>The general idea of my website design is as follows.<br>I created a bunny character named Bunnifer and I chose her as the main element of the appearance design. Based on Bunnifer, I created several icons for the sidebar on different pages.<br>The home page is a simple greeting, you can move the cursor over the rabbit to see her move closer to you.<br>On the ‘about me’ page, I added a brief introduction about myself and Bunnifer.<br>The ‘comm5961’ page is designed for this course. On this page, you can visit each of my assignments. Since assignment 1 is the home page and some guide pages, click ‘ASSIGNMENT 1’ on the navigation bar above will bring you to the home page.<br>The ‘design’ and ‘photography’ pages are still under construction, I will add more content soon.</p>
                <p class="three">One of the most interesting things I found in the process was ‘span’, which helps us to achieve different effects of text in the same area. Sometimes letters of various fonts, sizes and styles can make the paragraph looks more beautiful. <br>I also found many drawbacks of my coding skill. I was still not familiar enough with the ‘display’ and ‘position’ of elements, so it took me a long time to make the elements locate in the place I imagined. In addition, my coding is not well-organized. As a result, I often need to look for the exact location where I need to modify for a long time. I will keep fighting to improve!</p>
